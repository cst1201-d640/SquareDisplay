# SquareDisplay
## Description
Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer no greater than 15. The program should then display a square on the screen using the character ‘X’. The number entered by the user will be the length of each side of the square. 

## Example
For example, if the user enters 5, the program should display the following: 

>XXXXX<br>
XXXXX<br>
XXXXX<br>
XXXXX<br>
XXXXX<br>

If the user enters 8, the program should display the following: 

>XXXXXXXX<br>
XXXXXXXX<br>
XXXXXXXX<br>
XXXXXXXX<br>
XXXXXXXX<br>
XXXXXXXX<br>
XXXXXXXX<br>
XXXXXXXX<br>

## Requirements
1. Your program should use a named constant (i.e., a `final` variable) to store the max square size and refer to it throughout the program.
2. Ask the user repeatedely for valid input using a loop.

## Extra Credit
Please indicate which extra credit you are attempting.

1. (1 point) Ask the user for the character to use instead of always using `'X'`.
2. (2 points) Allow the user to draw a rectangle.
